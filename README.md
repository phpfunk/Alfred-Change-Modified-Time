This extension will change the modification time of any file or all files within a directory the current date and time.

This is helpful when using services like `git` where it preserves the modification time. Meaning you can pull files from a remote and the modification time will be the last time the other user changed the file.

Anyway, maybe this will be helpful for someone :)

### Compatibilty
Alfred 2+

### File Action
This extension is a file action, meaning you look for files or a directory with files in Alfred. When you find it you can press the '>' key to access the file actions menu. Click 'Change Modified Time to Now' and the file or files will be updated.

That's it.
